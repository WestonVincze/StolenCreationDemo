# IDEAS
> actions give exp, spend exp on a "talent" system

> cutting a tree rewards tree cutting perks

> do we want a feeling of "role progression" where the player gets better at the skills they use most

> ability to throw weapon

> resources? 
trees, stone, 

> crafting?
"safety pouch" -> keeping x number of items on death (players chooses)

> de-incentive for attacking other players?
instantly alert enemy players when you attack first

> building?
maybe building new safe havens
chests 

> how possible should it be for the lowest tier player to beat the highest? 

> dead trees every so often with "bugs" inside which can be used to craft other materials
> gems popping out of rocks
> ore: when the pickaxe hits a rock, a small rock pops out of the node in a random direction

> ability to raid bases 
should there be a win condition if you raid someone's base and destroy their heart?
